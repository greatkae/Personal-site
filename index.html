                <h2>The Basics</h2>
                <p>Football is a sport consisting of two teams. 11-a-side on the pitch with each team having about 8 players
                    on the bench. A game lasts for 90 minutes consisting of two 45 minute halves with a 15 minute break after the
                    first half. Throughout the course of the game, both managers are allowed to send out 5 players on the pitch in exchange for 
                    5 on the bench. These are called substitutions or subs for short.
                </p>
                <h3>How to score.</h3>
                <p>To score, a player simply has to kick the ball past the goal line. A goal in football has a value of 1 point.</p>

                <h2>Fouls and stoppages</h2>
                <p>Football, much like every other sport, has stoppages. Interesting enough, it has the least amount of stoppages than any other sport.
                    The most common occurence in football that causes stoppages is when there is rough play. An example with rough play is if a player tackles another
                    player with over-excessive force risking an injury. This would be called a foul and the referee has the responsibility to stop the game and turnover posession to the other team.
                </p>
                <h3>Offsides</h3>
                <p>The offside rule is one of the more complex rules in the game. Offsides are called by the linesman, one of the referees of the game. This happens when a player of one team passes the ball to his teammate behind
                    the defensive line of the opposing team. This rule makes the game more tactical and prevents a whole lot of easy goals.

                <h2>Who is on the pitch?</h2>
                <p>On the football pitch, we have the outfield players. These are the players on both teams actively playing the game. As mentioned before, It is 11 players on eatch side. A side consists
                    of Attackers; the players in the front usually responsible for scoring goals, Midfielders; The players in the middle 
                    responsible for both attacking and defending and giving the team a good shape, and lastly, the defenders; responsible for the defense of the team and stopping the team from conceding.
