        <H1>Do You Know Ball?</H1>
        <p>Here, we are going to go over the few basic rules of the sport.
            If you are not sure what sport we're talking about. Please go back to the homepage. I would like to add that this website is only for the basics.
            Dear user, do not expect too much.
        </p>

            <h2>Start and Restart of Play</h2>
            <p>The match begins with a kickoff from the center spot. The team that wins the coin toss chooses which goal to attack in the first half, while the other team takes the kickoff.
            After a goal is scored, the opposing team restarts the game with a kickoff.
            Play is restarted with a goal kick if the ball goes out of bounds over the goal line and was last touched by an attacking player, or with a corner kick if it was last touched by a defending player.</p>
            <h2>Fouls and Misconduct</h2>
            <p>A free kick is awarded to the opposing team for most fouls. The location of the free kick depends on the severity and location of the foul.
            Yellow cards are shown as a caution for unsporting behavior, dissent, or other misconduct. Two yellow cards in the same match result in a red card, leading to ejection from the game.
            A direct free kick can be taken directly at the goal, while an indirect free kick requires another player to touch the ball before a goal can be scored.</p>

            <h2>Penalty Kick</h2>
            <p>Awarded for fouls committed inside the penalty area (the box) by the defending team. It's a one-on-one opportunity for the attacking player 
                to score against the goalkeeper from the penalty spot, 12 yards from the goal.</p>
            <h2>Throw-In</h2>
            <p>Awarded to the opposing team of the player who last touched the ball before it crossed the side touchline. The throw-in is 
                taken with both hands from behind the head.</p>
            <h2>Goal Kick</h2> 
            <p>Awarded to the defending team when the attacking team kicks the ball over the defending 
                team's goal line without scoring.</p>
            <h2>Corner Kick</h2>
            <p>Awarded to the attacking team when the defending team kicks the ball over their own goal line without scoring.</p>   
        </div> 
        <p>There are a lot more rules in the game that apply to more complex situations in higher levels of the game,
            but these rules specefically, you will find applied in every game.
